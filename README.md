# odin-sign-up-form
This project is part of the Odin Project to practice creating and styling forms using HTML and CSS

The end result should look something like this image: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png

Things I have learned in this project:

-to check current text in input with JS check element.value, not element.textContent

-using element.setAttribute() to change class or other attribute values in DOM

-importing custom font through files

-using relative and absolute positioning to place elements 

-validating form information using JS and CSS classes to inform the user if valid or not and control submissions

-styling forms (how to group inputs and labels, place them, style their borders and :focus, etc.)

-design ideas like matching color themes to the main picture
